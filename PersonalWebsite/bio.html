        <p>Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm a student at Cal Poly Pomona</p>
        <p><br>I'm from Southern California, born to two Vietnamese immigrants.  My interest in computers started when I was young.  It started when I saw how amazing video games like Warcraft 3, and Starcraft were and I wanted to learn how to program, but I didn't offically start learning programming until high school, when I had a math teacher who taught programming for fun.  This class started my interest in programming and I was hooked.</p>
