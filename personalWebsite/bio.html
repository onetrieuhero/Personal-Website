        <p>Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm a student at Cal Poly Pomona</p>
        <p><br>I'm from Southern California, born to two Vietnamese immigrants.  My interest in computers started when I was young.  It started when I saw how amazing video games like Warcraft 3, and Starcraft were and I wanted to learn how to program, but I didn't officially start learning programming until high school, when I had a math teacher who taught programming for fun.  This class started my interest in programming and I was hooked from then on.</p>
        <p><br>After being inspired by the class, I decided to major in Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona.  An engineering school where their philosophy is "Learn by Doing." I really love the ability to do CS at this school, as it allows me to get a hands on approach, where I actually put what I learn to practice.  Being at this school has allowed me to push my education past what is required.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 100px"><br>My interest include video games, music, weightlifting, and of course programming.  I just love the challenges associated with each one of these hobbies and the idea of constantly improving. Though I am still a student who has much to learn, I'm ready for the challenges that lie ahead of me.
